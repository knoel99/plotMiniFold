# plotMiniFold
The purpose of this project is to plot the proteins used in the MiniFlod project, based on the coordinates of the amino acids

The files are:
* plotMiniFold.py: This file is used to draw in 3D the amino acid chain in 3D
* preparePlot.py:  This file is used to prepare the coordinates of the amino acid of the protein
* testing.csv: This file is one of the data file
* validation.csv : This file is one of the data file, from the project 


## Context
The purpose is to plot in 3D the proteins avalaible in the project [MiniFold](https://github.com/EricAlcaide/MiniFold). The dataset was extracted from [ProteinNet](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet/blob/master/docs/proteinnet_records.md) project. 

In this projet we are able to plot the proteins in 3D based on the coordinates of the amino acids.


### Data on the proteins
The protein data are available [here](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet) and the structure of the data is explained [here](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet/blob/master/docs/proteinnet_records.md). The compressed folders can be extracted with 7-zip.

The data to retreive are located in the 'Tertiary structure section'.
